    <h1>Dear, Arushi💖</h1>

    <p>
      Happiest Birthday to my bestiee, my comfort person, and forever fav.🌸💕
      Life truly hits different with you around. From childhood memories to grown-up dreams, we've literally seen each
      other grow...same laughs, new problems, but the same unbreakable bond. From inside jokes only we understand to
      long conversations that heals without trying, i cherish every moment with you. You're the one I talk to freely
      without hesitating...bina filter, bina soche samjhe itni bakwaas krti hu or tum utne he interest se
      sunti..🥹..Big respect🫡You're turning 21,(mai bhi jald he tumko join krungi🫡), i still can't believe it😩.. where did all this time go?
      This age brings responsibilities ,changes, and fears, but don't be scared ..C’est la vie(This is life) , and
      you're stronger than you think.I know I hurt you in the past, and I’m truly sorry. That mistake still comes back to me again and again. Even though time has passed, it doesn’t feel right in my heart, and I regret it deeply.I know that saying “sorry” can never truly make up for what I did, but for some reason, I feel that if I say it, it might ease the hurt just a little. I know it probably won’t change everything, but I wanted to write this because I could never say this in person.... No matter how much we grow or how far life takes us, I'll always be by your
      side😊-cheering you on, holding you up, and choosing you every single time🫂.. Almost 16 year of us, and
      that's not just a friendship,Its a lifetime promise🫶✨love you sm🫂🎀
